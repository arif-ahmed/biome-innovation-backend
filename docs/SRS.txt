Author: Software Architect
Status: Formal Requirement Document
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to specify the functional and non-functional requirements for the BiomeInnovation Digital Platform. This system is designed to digitalize pet health operations, replacing manual legacy processes with a dynamic, secure, and scalable Serverless Web Application. It manages the full lifecycle of pet health testing: from kit ordering to laboratory processing and automated report delivery.
1.2 Scope
The platform encompasses the following modules:
● Customer Portal: Order management and report visualization.
● Lab Assistant Panel: Laboratory data entry and sample tracking.
● Admin Panel: System governance and business oversight.
● Serverless Infrastructure: Cloud-native backend (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB).
● Report Microservice: Automated analysis and PDF generation engine.
● Third-Party Integrations: Payment (Stripe), Shipping APIs, and MS365 Email.

2. Overall Description
2.1 User Characteristics
● Customers: Pet owners requiring a seamless UI to purchase kits, track sample progress, and understand complex health data via simplified reports.
● Lab Assistants: Technical staff requiring a high-efficiency interface for accurate, high-volume data entry and status management.
● Administrators: Business managers requiring high-level visibility into financial transactions, order flow, and user access control.
2.2 Operating Environment
● Cloud Provider: Amazon Web Services (AWS).
● Hosting Model: 100% Serverless architecture to minimize maintenance overhead and provide cost-effective scaling.
● Client Side: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) via a responsive Single Page Application (SPA).
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Authentication & Authorization (AuthN/AuthZ)
● REQ-01: Users must be able to Register, Login, and Reset Passwords via email.
● REQ-02: Support for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is mandatory for enhanced security.
● REQ-03: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must distinguish between Customers, Lab Assistants, and Admins.
● REQ-04: API Gateway must handle initial authentication tokens before invoking backend logic.
3.2 Customer Panel
● REQ-05 (Order Management): Customers shall be able to purchase Microbiome Test Kits.
● REQ-06 (Payment): Integration with Stripe (or equivalent) ensuring PCI/DSS compliance. Data must be encrypted at rest in DynamoDB.
● REQ-07 (Visibility): Real-time tracking of sample status (e.g., "Received," "Processing," "Complete").
● REQ-08 (Report Access): Secure viewing and downloading of PDF reports upon completion.
● REQ-09 (Support): Integrated ticketing system for customer inquiries.
● REQ-10 (Communication): Subscription management for health newsletters.
3.3 Lab Assistant Panel
● REQ-11 (Data Entry): Secure interface for manual import of complex sample data and test results.
● REQ-12 (Search): Lookup capabilities for orders via Order ID or Customer Name.
● REQ-13 (Workflow): Ability to update the current processing stage of any active sample.
3.4 Report Generation Microservice
● REQ-14 (Trigger): Automatic process initiation upon Lab Assistant data submission.
● REQ-15 (Logic): Analysis of sample data against predefined health benchmarks to generate pet-specific suggestions.
● REQ-16 (PDF): Generation of formatted PDF reports stored securely in AWS S3.
● REQ-17 (Notification): Automated alerts (Email/SNS) to customers once reports are finalized.
3.5 Admin Panel
● REQ-18 (User Control): Management interface to view, edit, or ban user accounts.
● REQ-19 (Oversight): Holistic dashboards for orders, financial transactions, and system health.
3.6 External Integrations
● REQ-20 (Shipping): API integration to map addresses and generate shipping labels for kit delivery.
● REQ-21 (Email): Routing of system communications via Microsoft 365 (MS365) infrastructure.
4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance
● REQ-N01: API response time (latency) must be ≤ 200ms for standard requests.
● REQ-N02: System must utilize AWS auto-scaling to handle traffic surges without manual intervention.
4.2 Security
● REQ-S01: All PII (Personally Identifiable Information), payment data, and lab results must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
● REQ-S02: Full compliance with PCI/DSS standards.
● REQ-S03: Internal Lab tools should utilize VPC endpoints or Private APIs to reduce the public attack surface.
4.3 Reliability & Availability
● REQ-R01: Target uptime of 99.9%.
● REQ-R02: Automated daily backups using DynamoDB on-demand backup capabilities.
4.4 Maintainability
● REQ-M01: Full CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and multi-environment deployment (QA, Pre-Prod, Prod).
● REQ-M02: Version control managed via GitHub with a structured branching strategy.
5. Technical Stack Component Technology Purpose Frontend React.js / Vue.js User-facing Single Page Application. Hosting AWS S3 + CloudFront Global content delivery and static hosting.
